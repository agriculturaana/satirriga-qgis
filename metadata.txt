about=SatIrriga QGIS is the official desktop client for the SatIrriga platform, a satellite-based irrigation monitoring system developed jointly by ANA (Brazil's National Water and Sanitation Agency) and INPE (Brazil's National Institute for Space Research). The plugin enables a complete field-validation workflow without leaving the QGIS environment: authenticate securely via Single Sign-On (OIDC/PKCE through Keycloak); browse and query irrigation mapping campaigns; download classification layers as editable GeoPackage files; refine geometries using the full suite of QGIS sketching and editing tools; and submit the revised data back to the SatIrriga server. Designed for analysts and technicians who review remote-sensing-derived irrigation maps, the plugin streamlines the review-and-correction cycle that is central to the SatIrriga quality-assurance process.
